=== UPDATING AN INSTALLED VERSION OR MODULE ===

 '''NOTE BEFORE UPDATING'''
 
 
 Because of the extensive changes and database modifications in v0.6b, 
 certain data will be replaced.  This should not affect your client,
 product, or invoice records, but may affect saved searches and sorts,
 displayable columns and report definitions.  If you wish to save these
 records, you may need to integrate the updates by hand. The 
 updatexml.php files give a general walkthrough on what changes are 
 needed
 
 * If you are updating or upgrading your current installation of phpBMS 
   from a web browser point to the update.php file located in the install 
   directory. (e.g. if you installed phpBMS to the root web folder 
   of www.mytest.com, point your browser to:
 
    http://www.mytest.com/install/update.php
