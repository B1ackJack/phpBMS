	<h1>Browser Requirements</h1>
	<p>This web application mimics many standard features of typical standard applications. Although this web application uses no plug ins such as Java, Active X, or flash, it does rely heavily on JavaScript, advanced style sheets and the use of cookies. To take full advantage of printing capabilities (although not required), it is recommended that you have the Adobe Acrobat Reader application installed and that it's plug in are integrated into your web browser.</p>
	<ul>
    	<li><strong>JavaScript v2.0</strong><br>
        		<br>
		This application makes heavy use of Javascript. Most scripts use standard javascript and wherever possible, there is only minimal browser identification and work-arounds. One note about <strong>window pop-ups:</strong> This application does utilize JavaScript to open new windows. If you disable Javascript window opening (like in Mozilla or Opera) or are utilizing a 3rd-party application to stop Internet Explorer (IE) from opening unwanted windows, this application might not work correctly. Hopefully in the future, you will be able to allow pop-ups from trusted sites, and thus get around this problem easily.<br>
&nbsp; </li>
    	<li><strong>Accept Cookies</strong><br>
        		<br>
		A single cookie is set to identify the user during a session. It solely supplies identification information and has a limited life span (I think 30 minutes). However, if your browser is set up not to accept cookies, this application will not work at all.<br>
&nbsp; </li>
    	<li><strong>Style Sheets (CSS)</strong><br>
        		<br>
		Your browser must support Cascading Style Sheets. Most of the implementations try to conform to CSS v2. If not correctly implemented by the browser the application might do more than just display incorrectly as some JavaScript might break. <br>
		<br>
    		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Tested Browsers</h2>
	<p>We are constantly testing on different browsers and will try to keep as up-to-date as possible. To date,this application has been tested with the following web browser applications:</p>
