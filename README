= phpBMS - README =
-------------------
=== Jan 29 2017 update ===
Since this application seemed to have been dead for many years, I have decided to make it work on newer php7 servers
Currently I have tackled the main mysql connection issues, and can login and look around a little however there is a lot
more to do. I am doing this in spare time, I am a beginner programmer, BUT i have been using phpBMS for many years and
am stuck forcing my server to run in old PHP version to keep it working.

IF anyone out there has the slightest interest PLEASE PLEASE let me know that way I can feel that my efforts will be used by 
others
message me on here, or shoot me an email kenny@quast.ca

will update the code on here this week to let others take advantage of it, but right now its still slightly broken once logged in.


=== SERVER REQUIREMENTS ===

Your server must be running at least:
 * MySQL Server 5.0+
 * PHP 5.2.0+ with MySQL support enabled. <-- This doesnt work anymore KQ
 * PHP 7 with MySQLi support <-- You now need this KQ
 * Apache 2.0 or higher


=== INSTALLATION ===

 * To install, from a web broswer, point to the index.php file located
   in the install directory. (e.g. if you installed phpBMS to the root
   web folder of www.mytest.com, point your browser to:

    http://www.mytest.com/install/
    OR
    http://www.mytest.com/install/index.php

 * Follow the instructions on the installation page


=== UPDATING AN INSTALLED VERSION OR MODULE ===

 * If you are updating or upgrading your current installation of phpBMS
   from a web browser point to the update.php file located in the install
   directory. (e.g. if you installed phpBMS to the root web folder
   of www.mytest.com, point your browser to:

    http://www.mytest.com/install/update.php

 * Follow the instructions on the update page


 == AFTER INSTALL/UPDATE ==
 
 * Be sure to make note of the admin password given to you at the end of the
   installation process.

 * You will need to delete your installation directories in the application
   root and any installation directories in your modules directories.
   (e.g. the /modules/bms/install/ directory)
